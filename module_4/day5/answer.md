Q1 – Role of Frontend (FE) – How to write it

Think of frontend as what the user sees and touches.
In your own words, write things like:
Frontend is the part of a web application that runs in the browser. It is responsible for designing and displaying the user interface. It includes things like buttons, forms, colors, layouts, and screens. When users click, type, or scroll, the frontend handles these actions and shows immediate responses.

Then explain interaction:
Users interact with the application through the frontend. For example, when a user fills a login form or clicks “Submit”, the frontend collects this data and prepares it to be sent to the server.

Then backend communication:
The frontend sends requests to the backend using APIs (like HTTP requests). It receives responses (such as success messages or data) and displays them to the user.

Q2 – Role of Backend (BE) – How to write it

Think of backend as the brain of the application.
Write in your own words:
Backend is the server-side part of a web application. It processes user requests, runs business logic, and decides what should happen when a user performs an action.
Server-side processing:
When the frontend sends data (like login details), the backend checks whether the data is correct and performs required actions.
Database handling:
Backend stores, retrieves, updates, and deletes data from the database such as user accounts, orders, or products.
Security & authentication:
Backend verifies users, manages passwords, controls access, and protects data from unauthorized users.
Business Logic

Q3 – Business Logic
Business logic means rules of the system.

Write like:
Business logic is the set of rules that decide how an application behaves. It controls what is allowed and what is not allowed.
Examples you can explain:
Online shopping
If stock is 0, the system should not allow purchase.
Banking app
A user cannot withdraw more money than their balance.
Login system
User must enter correct username and password to log in.

Q4 – Client–Server Model

Write in simple terms:
The client–server model is a way of communication between two sides.
Client:
The client is the user’s device (browser or mobile app).
Server:
The server is a powerful computer that stores data and runs the application.
Communication:
The client sends a request (like “login” or “get data”) and the server processes it and sends back a response.

Q5 – Three-Tier Architecture

Explain:
Three-tier architecture divides a web application into three layers.
Presentation layer:
This is the frontend – what users see and interact with.
Application layer:
This is where business logic runs.
Data layer:
This stores the database.
Why it is used:
It makes the system easier to manage, more secure, and easier to scale.

Q6 – JavaScript as a Backend Language

Explain:

JavaScript is used on backend because it is fast, efficient, and works well with modern web apps.

Performance:
Node.js allows JavaScript to handle many users at the same time.

Ecosystem:
JavaScript has many libraries and tools.

Frameworks:
Examples: Express.js, NestJS, Node.js.
